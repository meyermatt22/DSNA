# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# class Solution(object):
#     def findPeakElement(self, nums):

#         left, right = 0, len(nums)-1

#         while left < right:
#             mid = left + (right-left)//2

#             if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
#                 left = mid+1
#             else:
#                 right = mid

#         return left

class Solution(object):
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):

        def _search(left, right):
            if left == right: return left

            mid = left + (right-left)//2
