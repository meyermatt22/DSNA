# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:

            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if (mid == 0 or nums[mid - 1] < nums[mid]) and (mid == len(nums) - 1 or nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]):
                return mid
            elif mid > 0 and nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
